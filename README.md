# Netmiko_Audiocode_Driver
Repository for files related to Netmiko Library specifically for Audiocode devices, both SSH and Telnet

This driver was designed using the 2.4.2 version of the Netmiko Library by ktbyers, all credit goes to him for an excellent library.

How to install:

*I would first suggest backing up your current ssh_dispatcher.py file (copy and rename ssh_dispatcher_copy.py)

*Simply copy and paste the new netmiko foler to your netmiko folder, select copy and replace which will override the ssh_dispatcher.py file in the root folder and add the newly created "audiocode" folder which contains the driver files.
